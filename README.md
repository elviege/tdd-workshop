# How to use this repository
- Create a fork of the repository
- Start with the "master" branch
- Read the next two paragraphs (*Requirements* and *Step 1*) of this README.md file
- Create a new branch from the "master" branch; you can call it "my-step-1"
- Complete the first task, commit and push your implementation to "my-step-1"
- Check the "step-1" branch and compare it to "my-step-1"
- Create a new branch from the "my-step-1" branch; you can call it "my-step-2"
- Repeat the process until you reach the end of this README.md file

# Steps
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*VjbieOROPmnqlGCw.png)
## Step 1
- Implement ```CreditCalculator``` via ```CreditCalculatorTests```
- Use ```Bogus``` to generate test data
- Use 3 datasets with xUnit (control examples)
- Check coverage
- Don't implement ```CalculateAsync```, implement ```Calculate``` instead
- Introduce ```ICriminalRecordChecker``` interface

## Step 2
- Use ```AutoFixture``` to generate test data
- Use ```FsCheck``` to improve coverage

## Step 3
- Implement a request handler using ```MediatR```
- Implement validators, using ```FluentValidator```

## Step 4
- Use ```WebApplicationFactory``` to test validator
- Use ```Moq``` to mock ```CriminalRecordChecker```

## Step 5
- Implement View
- Test View using ```WebDriver```

## Step 6
- Replace View with React
- Update e2e tests
